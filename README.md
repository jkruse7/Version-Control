## Office hours

If you have questions about this week's lab ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.

## Version control! :tada:

If you didn't make a GitHub account already, do that super quick right now _because_:

This week we will be applying some of our command-line knowledge to learn how to use `git`! The format for today is the same as last week: follow along with me in your lecture notebook. Then, at the end, I'll explain your group project assignment!

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/Version-Control.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `Version-Control`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `Lab-Exercises.ipynb` notebook. You can also launch `Lab-Lesson.ipynb` if you need a refresher on what the UTA went over in the skills lab.

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Completing the Lab

This week you don't need to fill out a Jupyter notebook. Instead you'll be creating a Github repository and populating it with content. You'll submit a link to the repository and we will verify that all of you contributed to the work.

This lab and the next one are meant to teach you how to use git and github to collaborate on software engineering projects. You cannot practice collaboration if you are working alone. You must work on this week's and next week's skills lab in a group. You will not receive any credit for this skills lab or the next one you attempt to complete them on your own. Furthermore, you will be working in the same group for both labs. This makes it especially crucial for you to come to lab section to find a partner. If you can't make it to lab section, you should try to find a group through the Discord server.

You may work in a group of two or three people.

## Submitting your lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you submit your repository. You should take the following steps:
1. Join a group on Canvas. Here are [instructions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-join-a-group-as-a-student/ta-p/468) for how to join a group. Make sure you join one of the groups called "Version Control skills lab group X".
2. Make sure your repository is public if it's not already. Here are [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) for how to make it public. If your repository is private then we can't see your team's commits and you will temporarily receive a 0.
3. One and only one of you needs to submit a url to the repository page. If you joined a group correctly, one submission will count for all of you.
4. We will look at the commit history and give credit to all group members who contributed. Additionally we will not give any credit if the repository only has one contributor.
